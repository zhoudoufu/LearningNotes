* 1, Basic core knowledge of tensorflow
  -  1.1 use non-keras tensorflow ops in eager mode (useful for unit test / debugging ) 
  -  1.2 symbolic operations vs. non symbolic (* make note of what I have discovered )
  -  1.3 tensorflow vs. pytorch
  -  1.4 basic file types (eventfile / protocol buffer)
  -  1.5 tensorflow 2.0 (major diff)
* 2, keras & ASR seq2seq implementation 
  -  what I have done save core code 
  -  try other way of applying it (data feed built in stuff, what to do to continue)
* 3, Tensorboard & debugging (tfdbg / http://josh-tobin.com/troubleshooting-deep-neural-networks.html)
  -  some basic ideas about what is grpc (进程间通信)
* 4, Bazel (when to use it)
* 5, Custom Ops (steps)
* 6, Tensorflow Lite (how to apply)
* 7, Tensorflow source reading (How to start , basic idea of how tensorflow is structured )
